# Sorting Visualization

Description:-
 I have implemented this project to visualize all the sorting Algorithms.This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.
